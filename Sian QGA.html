                  <li>In May 2018 I was First Aider at the Fulham Brownie Adventure weekend at Paccar campsite outisde of London.
                    This was a great weekend as I have not been a leader at a Brownie Sleepover.
                     We let the girls pitch tents and 21 out out 28 slept outside, for 11 of them it was their first time in a tent!

                  <li> Summer 2018 Guide Camp. In July 2018 my Fulham Guides and I jumped on the National Epxress Coach to Cheltenham.
                    I helped to organise a Guide Camp with my Fulham Guides and my unit I was a Guide in, in Gloucestershire.
                    Over 4 nights the 2 units got to know each other and became good friends.
                    Activities included camp cooking, zip wire, day trip to Cirencester outdoor pool (on the hottest day of summer!)....
                  </li>

                  <li>In 2016 I undertook a study in conjection with the University of Exeter into the Leadership Programme of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS).
                    I presented my findings to the WAGGGS Leadership comittee at Pax Lodge.

                  <li>In July 2017 I completed my Going Away With Licence for Senior Section. The weekend was a prep weekend for the girls going on the INTOPS trip to Slovakia.
                    We took over the hall at Deer Park Cowley. Weekend was a great success with the leaders definitely getting more sleep than the girls!
                  </li>
                  <li> My Exploration took myself and 2 friends to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2018.
                    Flights and accomodation booked and a programme ordered! We went to a mix of comedy, theatre, street music, accapella, interpretation, short plays and late night music!
                    Our aim was to go to events we wouldnt normally choose! My favourite was "Showstoppers"!
                    Whilst in Edinburgh wee took the chance to see the cultutal highlights including walking up Arthurs Seat and taste the local cusine!

                  <li> For this I jumped back into the pool! Between the ages 9-15 this was a regular, three times a week activity with galas and competitions at the weekends.
                    However distance events were my nemisis... so at the end of 2017 I decided my challenge was to complete the 5k Swimathon (200 lengths of a 25m pool!!) and explore swimmming outdoors.
                    Training began and I joined Clapham Chasers for the swimming sessions (and very occasional run), went to loads of different pools and completed my first 5K in 1 hour 48. I also raised over Â£200 for chairty. Over the summer I went to Lidos all over London making the most of the sun.
                    March 2019, I'm still swimming and knocked 12 minutes off my 5k time... I've got the bug again for swimming.... roll on the <strong>10k</strong> in July.
